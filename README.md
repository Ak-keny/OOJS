Alt-#Ready Phrase Hunter ?

A mix of Wheel of Fortune (TV Show) and Ready Player one (Movie)

This browser-based word guessing game was build using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or using the physical keyboard


In this project, you'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." You’ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

The player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase and win, or make five incorrect guesses and lose.

The player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
